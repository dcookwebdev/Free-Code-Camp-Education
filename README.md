# Free Code Camp Education

These are my notes, resources, scripts, and tests that I am utilizing as a I work through the course material at [freecodecamp.com](www.freecodecamp.org)

As I'm learning Front End Development tools and technology, I want to take full advantage of the steps I'm taking. To that end I'm creating notes and doing a few supplemental things:

- If I don't know much about something that I'm learning, research more information on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- Copy my code into my notes with anything additional I may have learned
- If there is a more expansive exercise, create a script and a unit test for it and use Jasmine to test it (client side).
- Use github to host my notes so I can learn git!
