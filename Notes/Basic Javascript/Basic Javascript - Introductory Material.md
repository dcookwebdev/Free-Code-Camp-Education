## Comments

We have two types of comments. Inline, and multi-line.

```js
// this is an inline comment

/* this is
a
multi
line
comment
/*
```

> Best Practice
> As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.
