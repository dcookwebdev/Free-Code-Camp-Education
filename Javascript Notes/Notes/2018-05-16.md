## Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication [132]

`myVar = myVar * 5;` = `myVar *= 5;`

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Division [133]

`myVar = myVar / 5;` = `myVar /= 5;`

## Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit [134]

### Code for the exercise
Had to add some simple math.

```js
function convertToF(celsius) {
    var fahrenheit;
    // Only change code below this line
    fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32
    
    // Only change code above this line
    return fahrenheit;
  }
  
  // Change the inputs below to test your code
  convertToF(30);
```

### Unit Test
*using Jasmine*

```js
describe("Convert Celcius to Farheinheit", () => {
    it("should return a number", () => {
        let n = convertToF(0);
        expect(typeof n).toBe("number");
    }),
    it("should return -22 when given -30", () => {
        expect(convertToF(-30)).toEqual(-22);
    }),
    it("should return 14 when given -10", () => {
        expect(convertToF(-10)).toEqual(14);
    }),
    it("should return 32 when given 0", () => {
        expect(convertToF(0)).toEqual(32);
    }),
    it("should return 68 when given 20", () => {
        expect(convertToF(20)).toEqual(68);
    }),
    it("should return 86 when given 30", () => {
        expect(convertToF(30)).toEqual(86);
    })
})
```

## Declare String Variables [135]

`var myName = "your name";`

## Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings [136]

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

## Quoting Strings with Single Quotes [137]

Good to use single quotes if there are many double quotes:

`'This string has "double quotes" in it. And "probably" lots of them.'`

## Escape Sequences in Strings [138]

### Common escape sequences:

```
Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
```

Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.


## Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator [139]

In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

`'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'`

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

## Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator [140]

```js
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
```

## Constructing Strings with Variables [141]

```js
var myName = "Dan";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am swell!";
```

## Appending Variables to Strings [142]

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

```js
var someAdjective = "awesome";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
```

## Find the Length of a String [143]

`"Alan Peter".length; // 10`

```js
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";.
lastNameLength = lastName.length;
```
