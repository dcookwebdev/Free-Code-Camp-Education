# Javascript

## Comments [114]

We have two types of comments. Inline, and multi-line.

```js
// this is an inline comment

/* this is
a
multi
line
comment
/*
```

> Best Practice
> As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.


## Declare JavaScript Variables [115]

> JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

- Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.
- Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

For now I know about ES6 `let` and `const` and more information about scope. Probably it will come later.

### Instructions
```js
// Example
var ourName;

// Define myName below this line
var myName;
```

## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator [116]

`myVariable = 5;` Assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

### Instructions
- Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.
- Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

```js
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;
```

## Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator [117]

It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

`var myVar = 0;` Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

### Instructions
Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.

```js
// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 9;
```

## Understanding Uninitialized Variables [118]

Points:

- When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
- If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
- If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

Question: is it good practice to declare a variable and leave it uninitialized?  
According to [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.asp) it is good practice to initialize variables for the following reasons:

- Give cleaner code
- Provide a single place to initialize variables
- Avoid undefined values
- **Initializing variables provides an idea of the intended use (and intended data type).**

Here's an example:

```js
// Declare and initiate at the beginning
var firstName = "",
    lastName = "",
    price = 0,
    discount = 0,
    fullPrice = 0,
    myArray = [],
    myObject = {};
```

### Instructions
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

Answer:
```js
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```


## Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables [119]

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. 

Javascript variables use camelcase.

### Instructions
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.

```js
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```

## Add Two Numbers with JavaScript [120]

`myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15`

## Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript [121]

`myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6`

## Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript [122]

`myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169`

## Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript [123]

`myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8`

## Increment a Number with JavaScript [124]

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

Remember this from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators):
```js
// Postfix 
var x = 3;
y = x++; // y = 3, x = 4

// Prefix
var a = 2;
b = ++a; // a = 3, b = 3
```

## Decrement a Number with JavaScript [125]

`i--;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i - 1;`

Also from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators);
```js
// Postfix 
var x = 3;
y = x--; // y = 3, x = 2

// Prefix
var a = 2;
b = --a; // a = 1, b = 1
```

## Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript [126]

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

FCC links to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems) to explain issues related to computers dealing with floats.

## Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript [127]

`var product = 2.0 * 2.5; // 5`

## Divide one Decimal by Another with JavaScript [128]

`var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // 2.2`

## Finding a Remainder in JavaScript [129]

The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

### Example
```
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
```

### Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

```
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
```

### Note
!! The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition [130]

`myVar = myVar + 5;` or `myVar += 5;`

## Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction [131]

`myVar = myVar - 5;` or `myVar -= 5;`
